# MACHINE LEARNING FOR ASSET MANAGERS

MLAM is a very interesting book I decided to deep dive and create a dedicated folder.

This folder structure will contain two subfolders

- notebooks/ --> .md file for the theory and .ipynb files for the exercises proposed by the authors/extensions of the concepts where needed
- scripts/ --> .py files with snippets from the authors/other functions
