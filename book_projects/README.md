# Deep Diving into Key Sources

The main purpose of this sub-repo folder is to deep dive into interesting books I can learn a lot from.

Differently from the quant-lab/learning_programme this folder contains sub-folders for each book I study.

Those books are mainly used to imporve the learning_programme itself, as I realized that the complexity is quite high and it is not sufficient to "read" those books to fully understand the models and the concepts that the authors present.

Hence, this is why this parallel folder has been created.

Here are the list of the books I have been through 

## Advances in Financial Machine Learning
Deals with the application of ML in finance in terms of data, issues, algorithms and, generally to how approach machine learning methods with financial time series.

Folder Structure:

- /data: contains data used for scripting and exerrcises
- /notebooks: contains subfolders divided by book chapters/concepts, each folder contains subfolders with this substrucutre
    - concept1/
        - .md files for the theory relative to the specific argument
        - .ipynb file/files for the practice where we tests and try the scripts proposed by the author
- /projects: contains exercised proposed by the book and/or extensions of these exercises in notebooks/tests/
- /scripts: contains .py file where we store the functions proposed by the authors or created/modified by me that are used in /notebooks and in /projects
