# Summary: Options Futures and Other Derivatives by J.C. Hull

## Ch.1: Introduction
Here is a summary of the key points from the provided source material on derivatives:

*   **Derivatives have become increasingly important in finance over the last 30 years** and are actively traded worldwide. They are used by various entities, including financial institutions, fund managers, and corporations, for diverse purposes.
*   The **derivatives market is huge**, significantly larger than the stock market in terms of underlying assets, and the value of these underlying assets is several times the world gross domestic product.
*   A **derivative is a financial instrument whose value depends on an underlying variable**, often the price of traded assets but can be almost any variable. Examples include stock options, credit derivatives, and weather derivatives.
*   Derivatives can be used for **hedging, speculation, or arbitrage** and play a key role in transferring risks in the economy.
*   Derivatives markets faced **criticism due to their role in the 2007 credit crisis**, where products based on risky mortgages became worthless, leading to significant financial losses and a recession. As a result, these markets are now more heavily regulated.
*   There are two main types of derivatives markets: **exchange-traded markets** and **over-the-counter (OTC) markets**.
    *   **Exchange-traded markets** involve standardized contracts defined by the exchange, such as those traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). These exchanges originally used open outcry but are increasingly adopting electronic trading.
    *   The **OTC market** is a network of dealers linked by phone and computer, where trades are usually between financial institutions or with their clients, and contract terms can be negotiated. The OTC market is much larger than the exchange-traded market in terms of total trading volume.
*   **Forward contracts** are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a future time for a certain price and are traded in the OTC market. One party takes a long position (agrees to buy), and the other takes a short position (agrees to sell). They can be used to hedge risks like foreign currency risk. The payoff for a long position is ST - K, and for a short position is K - ST, where K is the delivery price and ST is the spot price at maturity.
*   **Futures contracts** are similar to forward contracts but are normally traded on an exchange, which standardizes the contract features and provides a guarantee against default. Examples of underlying assets include commodities and financial assets.
*   **Options** give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price (strike price).
    *   **American options** can be exercised any time before expiration, while **European options** can only be exercised at expiration. Most exchange-traded options are American.
    *   Unlike forwards and futures, there is a cost to acquiring an option.
    *   The **Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)** is the largest exchange for stock options.
    *   Option prices are influenced by factors like the strike price and time to maturity.
    *   There are four types of participants in options markets: buyers and sellers of calls, and buyers and sellers of puts. Buyers have long positions, and sellers have short positions (writing options).
*   There are three broad categories of traders in derivatives markets:
    *   **Hedgers** use derivatives to reduce the risks they face from market variables. They might use forward contracts to fix future prices or options to provide insurance against adverse price movements.
    *   **Speculators** use derivatives to bet on the future direction of market variables, often using the leverage provided by these instruments to amplify potential gains and losses.
    *   **Arbitrageurs** take offsetting positions in two or more markets to lock in a riskless profit by exploiting price discrepancies. The existence of arbitrageurs tends to keep prices in line across different markets.
*   **Hedge funds** are significant users of derivatives for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage, often employing sophisticated and unconventional investment strategies.
*   Derivatives, despite their benefits, carry **dangers**. Traders may deviate from their mandate (e.g., hedging becoming speculation), leading to significant losses. It is crucial for organizations to establish controls and monitor derivative usage. The 2007 credit crisis also highlighted the risk of underestimating the correlation of risks and the potential for significant losses even within set risk limits.
