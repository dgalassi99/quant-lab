### ðŸ“š Theory
- [x] Study *Advances in Financial ML* â€“ Ch.2,3
- [x] Study *The Science of Algorithmic Trading* â€“ Ch.2  
- [x] Review Quantopian Lectures 11â€“12  
- [x] Understand why traditional ML struggles in finance  
- [x] Learn about financial features and data stationarity

### ðŸ’» Practice
- [ ] Download historical data and compute financial features (returns, vol, momentum, etc.)  
- [ ] Normalize/standardize features, handle NaNs, and resample for ML  
- [ ] Use `train_test_split()` to create your dataset

## 10  

### ðŸ“š Theory
- [ ] Study *Advances in Financial ML* â€“ Ch.4  
- [ ] Review Quantopian Lectures 13â€“14  
- [ ] Learn about labeling: fixed horizon, triple-barrier, and event-driven  
- [ ] Study common pitfalls: lookahead bias, imbalance, data leakage

### ðŸ’» Practice
- [ ] Implement binary labels using return thresholds  
- [ ] (Optional) Explore triple-barrier labeling as per LÃ³pez de Prado  
- [ ] Visualize label distributions and class imbalance

### ðŸ“š Theory
- [ ] Study *Advances in Financial ML* â€“ Ch.5  
- [ ] Study *The Science of Algorithmic Trading* â€“ Ch.7  
- [ ] Quantopian Lectures 15â€“16  
- [ ] Learn about Random Forests and Ensemble Methods (Bagging, Boosting)  
- [ ] What is feature importance? Why use SHAP in finance?

### ðŸ’» Practice
- [ ] Train a Random Forest Classifier on labeled data  
- [ ] Use SHAP to evaluate feature importance  
- [ ] Visualize confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score

## 12  

### ðŸ“š Theory  
- [ ] Read additional materials from LÃ³pez de Prado on model overfitting and cross-validation  
- [ ] Explore time series cross-validation and walk-forward CV  
- [ ] Discuss interpretability and trust in ML models

### ðŸ’» Practice  
- [ ] Implement XGBoost with cross-validation  
- [ ] Compare model performance: Random Forest vs XGBoost  
- [ ] Tune hyperparameters with `GridSearchCV` or `optuna`  
- [ ] Build a dashboard: accuracy, ROC-AUC, feature plots
