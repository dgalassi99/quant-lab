# Chapter 2: Fishing for Ideas

*   **Finding a trading idea is actually not the hardest part of building a quantitative trading business**. There are many trading ideas in the public sphere, accessible to anyone at little or no cost.
*   In the past, because of the author's academic bent, the author regularly perused various preprints published by business school professors or downloaded the latest online finance journal articles to scan for good prospective strategies. Increasingly, however, the author has found that **many strategies described by academics are either too complicated, out of date (perhaps the once-profitable strategies have already lost their power due to competition), or require expensive data to backtest (such as historical fundamental data)**.
*   Strategies **work only on small-cap stocks, whose illiquidity may render actual trading profits far less impressive than their backtests would suggest**.
*   This is not to say that you will not find some gems if you are persistent enough, but **I have found that many traders' forums or blogs may suggest simpler strategies that are equally profitable**.
*   However, the trick is that **you can often modify the basic strategy and make it profitable**.
*   Furthermore, **your bad ideas will quickly get shot down by your online commentators, thus potentially saving you from major losses**.
*   No, the difficulty is not the lack of ideas. **The difficulty is to develop a taste for which strategy is suitable for your personal circumstances and goals**, and look viable even before you devote the time to diligently backtest them. This taste for prospective strategies is what the author will try to convey in this chapter.
*   **Whether a strategy is viable often does not have anything to do with the strategy itself—it has to do with you**.
*   **Table 2.2 lists how capital (whether for trading or expenditure) constraint can influence many choices**.
*   Yet **if you do have survivorship bias, the backtest result can be unreliable**.
*   **Yet if you do have survivorship bias, much more information than those that have such a bias is needed.**
*   **Before proceeding to devote your time to performing a comprehensive backtest on this strategy (not to mention devoting your capital to actually trading this strategy), there are a number of quick checks you can do to make sure you aren't wasting your time or money.**
*   This point seems obvious when the strategy in question is a stock-trading strategy that buys (but not shorts) stocks. Everybody seems to know that **if a long-only strategy returns 10 percent a year, it is not too fantastic because investing in an index fund will generate as much, if not better, return on average.** However, if the strategy is a long-short dollar-neutral strategy (i.e., the portfolio holds long and short positions with equal capital), then 10 percent is quite a good return, because then the benchmark of comparison is not the market index, but a riskless asset such as the yield of the three-month U.S. Treasury bill (which at the time of this writing is about 4 percent).
*   This leads us to **consider the information ratio or Sharpe ratio (Sharpe, 1994), rather than returns, as the proper performance measurement of a quantitative trading strategy**.
*   The Sharpe ratio is defined as the **average of excess returns divided by the standard deviation of excess returns**.
*   The Sharpe ratio is **typically a special case of the information ratio, suitable when we have a dollar-neutral strategy, so that the benchmark is always the risk-free rate**.
*   If the Sharpe ratio is such a nice performance measure across different strategies, you may wonder **why it is not quoted more often instead of returns**.
*   A higher Sharpe ratio will actually allow you to make more profits in the end, since it allows you to trade at a higher leverage.
*   If a strategy trades only a few times a year, **chances are its Sharpe ratio won't be high.** This does not prevent it from being part of your multistrategy trading business, but it does disqualify the strategy from being your main profit center.
*   If a strategy has deep (e.g., more than 10 percent) or lengthy (e.g., four or more months) drawdowns, **it is unlikely that it will have a high Sharpe ratio.**
*   As a rule of thumb, **any strategy that has a Sharpe ratio of less than 1 is not suitable as a stand-alone strategy.** For a strategy that achieves profitability almost every month, its (annualized) Sharpe ratio is typically greater than 2. For a strategy that is profitable almost every day, its Sharpe ratio is usually greater than 3.
*   **A drawdown at a given time $t$ is defined as the difference between the current equity value (assuming no redemption or cash infusion) of the portfolio and the global maximum of the equity curve occurring on or before time $t$. The maximum drawdown is the largest it has taken for the equity curve to recover losses.** The global maximum is called the "high watermark." The maximum drawdown duration is the longest it has taken for the equity curve to recover losses.
*   Therefore something we may want to minimize. **Comparing your tolerance with the numbers obtained from the backtest of a candidate strategy determines whether that strategy is for you.**
*   You should ask yourself, realistically, **how deep and how long a drawdown will you be able to tolerate and not liquidate your portfolio and shut down your strategy?** Would it be 20 percent and three months, or 10 percent and one month, or perhaps even less?
*   **Every time a strategy buys and sells a security, it incurs a transaction cost.** The more frequently it trades, the larger the impact of transaction costs on the profitability of the strategy. **Transaction costs are not just due to commission fees** charged by the broker. There will also be the cost of liquidity—when you buy and sell securities at their market prices, you are paying the bid-ask spread. **You avoid the liquidity costs but incur opportunity costs.**
*   **This delay can cause a "slippage," the difference between the price that triggers the order and the execution price.** Of course, this slippage can be of either sign, but on average it will be a cost rather than a gain to the trader.
*   **Transaction costs vary widely for different kinds of securities.**
*   As an example of the impact of transaction costs on a strategy, **consider this simple mean-reverting strategy on ES (E-mini S\&P 500 futures): that is, every time the price exceeds plus or minus 2 moving standard deviations of its moving average, short or buy, respectively.** **Exit the position once the price reverts back to within 1 moving standard deviation of the moving average.** **You allow your self to enter and exit every five minutes, you will find that the Sharpe ratio to enter is about 3 without transaction costs—very excellent indeed!** **Unfortunately, the Sharpe ratio is reduced to −3 if we subtract 1 basis point as transaction costs, making it a very unprofitable strategy.**
*   **A historical database of stock prices that does not include stocks that have disappeared because of bankruptcies, delistings, mergers, or acquisitions suffers from the so-called survivorship bias.** Because only "survivors" of those often unpleasant events remain in the database. **Backtesting a strategy using data with survivorship bias can be dangerous because it may inflate the historical performance of that strategy.** **This is especially true if the strategy has a "value" bent; that is, it tends to buy stocks that are cheap.**
*   So when you read about a "buy on the cheap" strategy that has great performance, ask the author of that strategy whether it was tested on survivorship bias-free (sometimes called "point-in-time") data. **If not, be skeptical of its results.**
*   Have some of those stocks are missing because they went out of business, a long-only strategy would have looked better in the early period of the backtest than what the actual profit and loss (P\&L) would have been at that time. Therefore, **when judging the suitability of a strategy, one must pay particular attention to its performance in the most recent few years, and not be fooled by the overall performance, which inevitably includes some rosy numbers in the old days.**
*   If you build a trading strategy that has 100 parameters, **it is very likely that you can optimize those parameters in such a way that the historical performance will look fantastic.** **It is also very likely that the future performance of this strategy will look nothing like its historical performance and will turn out to be very poor.** By having so many parameters, **you are probably fitting the model to historical accidents in the past that will not repeat themselves in the future.**
*   Actually, this so-called **data-snooping bias is very hard to avoid even if you have just one or two parameters** (such as entry and exit thresholds).
*   At the risk of oversimplification, we can characterize artificial intelligence (AI) as trying to fit vast data points into a function with many, many parameters. **With many parameters, we can for sure capture small patterns that no human will ever replay.** **Experts in AI assure us that they have many safeguards in fitting the function to transient noise and indeed, such tools have been very effective in consumer marketing and credit card fraud detection.** Apparently, the patterns of consumers and thefts are quite consistent over time, allowing the patterns of algorithms to work even with a large number of parameters. **However, from my experience, these safeguards work far less well in financial markets prediction, and overfitting to the noise in historical data remains a rampant problem.**
*   **This is not to say that no methods based on AI will work in prediction. The ones that work for me are usually characterized by these properties:** They are based on a sound econometric or rational basis, and not on random discovery of patterns. They have few parameters that need to be fitted to past data. They involve linear regression only, and not fitting to some esoteric non-linear functions. They are conceptually simple. All optimizations must occur in a lookback moving window, involving no future unseen data. And the effect of this optimization must be continuously demonstrated using this future, unseen data.
*   Since this book is about starting a quantitative trading business from scratch, and not about starting a hedge fund that manages multiple millions of dollars, for example, strategies that have very low capacities because they trade too often, strategies that trade very few stocks every day, or strategies that have very infrequent positions (such as some seasonal trades in commodity futures described in Chapter 7). **Those niches are the ones that are likely still to be profitable because they have not yet been completely arbitraged away by the gigantic hedge funds.**
