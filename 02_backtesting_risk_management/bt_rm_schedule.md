### ðŸ“š Theory
- [x] Study *Quantitative Trading* â€“ Ch.4,5   
- [x] Watch Quantopian Lectures 5â€“6  
- [x] What makes a good backtest? Understand lookahead bias, overfitting, and market regime change.  
- [x] Learn the concept of position sizing and risk-adjusted returns.

### ðŸ’» Practice
- [x] Install and explore `bt` or `backtrader` â€” try running a basic MA strategy in either  
- [x] Write a modular backtesting class with: signal input, execution logic, performance stats  
- [x] Create position-sizing logic based on volatility or fixed allocation

### ðŸ“š Theory
- [x] Study *Quantitative Trading* â€“ Ch.6    
- [x] Review stop-loss and drawdown management  
- [x] Watch Quantopian Lectures 7â€“8  
- [x] Discuss the difference between simulation and real execution (slippage, fill models, etc.)

### ðŸ’» Practice
- [x] Implement stop-loss and take-profit logic in your backtest  
- [x] Add trailing stop and maximum drawdown exit conditions  
- [x] Simulate slippage and transaction costs, observe effect on performance

## Extra: Focus on *ML for Asset Managers*
I find that this book could be useful for general knowledge and mostly also for the next section of the studies which is based on ML in finance.

Hence, I will go through some or all the chapters of the book and create an ipynb file where I follow what is done and try to sole the exercises proposed --> Here is the link: https://github.com/dgalassi99/quant-trading-self-study/blob/main/00_books/Machine_Learning_for_Asset_Managers.ipynb

### ðŸ“š Theory
- [ ] Study *ML for Asset Managers* â€“ Ch.3 (focus: evaluation and validation)  
- [ ] Read *Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives* â€“ Ch.2  
- [ ] Watch Quantopian Lecture 9  
- [ ] What is walk-forward validation? Why is it crucial in live trading?  
- [ ] How to split datasets in-sample, out-of-sample, and test

### ðŸ’» Practice
- [ ] Apply walk-forward validation to your MA strategy

### ðŸ“š Theory  
- [ ] Study *Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives* â€“ Ch.3  
- [ ] Watch Quantopian Lecture 10

## ðŸ“¦ Final Deliverables  
- âœ… A backtesting engine in Python (can use `bt` or `backtrader`)  
- âœ… A notebook: `Backtest_MA_Strategy_with_Risk_Controls.ipynb`  
- âœ… A 1-pager including:
  1. Strategy description and enhancements (e.g., stop-loss)  
  2. Performance overview with walk-forward validation  
  3. Plots, summary tables, and lessons learned  
- âœ… A short doc summarizing key insights from:
  - *Quantitative Trading* Ch.5â€“6  
  - *ML for Asset Managers* Ch.3  
  - *Inside the Black Box* Ch.3â€“4
