# Summary: Practice of Mathematical Finance by M.S. Joshi
## Ch.1: Risk

*   **Risk is a central concept in modern finance**, and every transaction can be viewed as the buying or selling of risk. An asset is considered **riskless** if its future value is precisely determined, with a prime example being a government bond from a reliable government. However, even government bonds carry some risk related to changing interest rates.
*   A **risky asset** is one with an uncertain future value, essentially synonymous with uncertainty. Most assets other than the safest government bonds fall into this category, including shares, foreign currency, and property. The riskiness of an asset should be judged against the return of a riskless government bond over the same period.
*   **Market efficiency** is a core concept suggesting that all available information about an asset is already reflected in its price. While not perfectly true, the actions of numerous participants trying to "beat the market" make it sufficiently accurate for practical purposes. Weak market efficiency implies that past price movements cannot be used to predict future prices. Insider trading is considered a crime because it exploits non-public information that is not yet included in the share price.
*   The **riskiness of an asset is incorporated into its price**, meaning riskier assets are expected to yield greater returns on average to compensate investors for the higher chance of losing money. There is no guaranteed high return without risk.
*   **Hedging and diversification** are two main strategies for managing risk. Hedging involves taking offsetting positions to eliminate risk, while diversification involves spreading investments across a range of assets to reduce the impact of any single asset's poor performance. The market only compensates investors for **systemic risk**, which cannot be diversified away.
*   **Bonds**, particularly government bonds, are a fundamental asset class. They typically pay a regular **coupon** and return the **principal** at the **maturity date**. **Zero-coupon bonds** pay no interest but are bought at a discount to their face value. The **yield** of a bond reflects the effective interest rate implied by its market price and can differ from the coupon. Longer-dated bonds generally have higher yields to compensate for increased uncertainty. **Corporate bonds** are issued by companies and typically offer a higher coupon than government bonds due to the risk of default.
*   **Stocks or shares** represent ownership in a public limited company (plc) and offer **limited liability** to shareholders, capping their potential losses to the amount invested. Shareholders can gain from increases in share value and through **dividends**, which are payments from company profits. The average return on shares is generally higher than on bonds or bank deposits to compensate for the greater risk.
*   **Derivatives** are financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying variable or asset. They can be used for **hedging, speculation, or arbitrage**. Examples include forward contracts, futures contracts, and options.
    *   A **forward contract** is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a future date for a price agreed today.
    *   **Options** give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a specific price (strike price) by a certain date. Options have a positive value because they carry rights without obligations.
    *   The financial derivatives market allows for the management of various risks, including foreign currency risk, credit risk (through credit derivatives), and commodity price risk. **Weather derivatives** are a growing area, with payoffs based on weather conditions.
    *   Derivatives differ from insurance primarily in that they are **hedgeable** and are based on the occurrence of events rather than losses.
    *   Options can be viewed as tools to encapsulate specific pieces of risk, and while they can lead to large gains or losses due to their sensitivity to market changes, their purpose is often to reduce risk.
*   Market participants can be broadly classified by their attitude towards risk:
    *   **Hedgers** use market instruments to reduce their risks. Companies often use derivatives for hedging currency and commodity price exposure.
    *   **Speculators** use market instruments to increase their risk in pursuit of higher returns. Private investors are often considered speculators when buying shares.
    *   **Arbitrageurs** seek to profit from price discrepancies by simultaneously buying in one market and selling in another without taking on risk. Banks often act as arbitrageurs.
    *   Banks also act as speculators when making loans.
*   The use of derivatives can lead to significant losses if traders break established rules or if companies use hedging instruments for speculation. Proper risk management and understanding the purpose of hedging are crucial.
*   Mathematical finance focuses on understanding how to use market instruments to cancel out randomness through hedging and to understand the consequences of these actions. The ability to identify mispricings in derivative products relies on complex mathematics.
